# Local values
The local values (_local values_), similar to the variables function, allow to store values, for their reference in the code. 
There are two main reasons to use __locals__ and not __variables__:
- It allows expressions and concatenation of variables to establish their value.
- It allows to make reference to other __locals__.
- It increases the speed of code execution.
